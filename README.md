# redux-project-2021

## About this project

- I worked on this to refresh my memory and learn redux-toolkit and practice working with slices and new action. I also wanted to use this project for future reference as well to possibly help speed up development.

## How to navigate this project

- For this project I used React-redux, and styled this project using CSS-modules.
- The components are separated into their own respective folders.There is store folders which has authorization reducer and counter reducer which are combined into one reducer in the index file using configureStore.
- There are four branches and each branch was created to sort bookmark important concepts in redux-toolkit, within this project.
